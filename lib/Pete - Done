What is a conditonal?  
A conditional is used in coding  for the program to take certain actions if certain conditions have been met.  
if, else, and else if statements are all used here.
a coding example that I found online was if the name entered in is put in as Peter then the response would be "Hello Peter"
if the name entered was not Peter then the response would be "Hello someone else

What is the difference betwen = and ==?
